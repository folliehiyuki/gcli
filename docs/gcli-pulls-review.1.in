.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Sy WARNING!
This feature is rather new. Expect bugs and broken features. Please
report in case you hit any of them. This also applies to this manual
page.
.Pp
The
.Nm
subcommand can be used to perform code review tasks for pull requests
on Git forges supported by gcli.
.Pp
Running this subcommand will drop you into your editor and lets you
annotate the diff of the PR.
Comments are always above the change they refer to. A change is
either a single diff line or multiple lines wrapped in curly braces
on the lines surrounding the change. Comments may be prefixed with
.Dq > :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
@@ foo.md -0,0 +0,0 @@ hunk starts here
 No change
This is a single line comment
+Foo
 
> This is is a multiline comment on a multiline diff.
>
> Comment continues here.
{
 not a change
-Removed this line
+Added this line
+Added another line.
}
 this is also not a change
.Ed
.Pp
The above example produces two comments, the first referring only to the addition of
.Dq Foo
and the second referring to 4 lines surrounded by the curly braces.
.Pp
Everything leading up to the first diff will be attached as a
top-level comment for your review.
.Pp
After you saved and exited the editor you will be asked what actions
to take on your review. This allows you to request changes, approve
the changes, leave a plain comment or to postpone the review locally.
